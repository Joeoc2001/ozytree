\- Percy Shelley, "Ozymandias"

With the productive power of Ozytree, you too can become a king of kings who first achieves great things and then inevitably becomes a symbol of the transcience of all achievement. Ozytree helps you do this with five key features:

- It lets you keep track of your tasks.
- Unlike all those peasant to-do-list programs, Ozytree acknowledges that your tasks naturally form a nested tree structure. It is a to-do-**tree** program.
- Ozytree foregoes all that hippy GUI nonsense, instead using a fast, productive command line interface.
- Ozytree maintains a record of every state your task tree has ever been in. You can manage history in a Git-style fashion, and browse through snapshots of your task tree in time.
- Ozytree does absolutely nothing to forestall the inevitable death and decay of you and everything you do.

## Usage

You need [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

Once you have Racket, and have downloaded the Ozytree source folder, navigate into it and run `racket main.rkt`. If it is your first time starting Ozytree, you will be guided through the configuration process.

Help will eventually be available in the program itself through the currently-unimplemented `help` command.
